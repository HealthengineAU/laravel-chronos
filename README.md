This is a custom package designed for Laravel Eloquent. It provides a trait that can be used in model classes that will
cast datetime fields to ChronosInterface instead of Carbon instances.

Chronos is a drop-in replacement for Carbon but is immutable by default. It also provides an interface that can be used
for some genericising as well.

See the [Chronos documentation](https://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/chronos.html) for more information.

## Usage

To convert datetime casts from Carbon instances to Chronos instances in an Eloquent model, all you need to do is `use`
this trait in the model. An example is shown below:

```php
use HealthEngine\LaravelChronos\ChronosTimestamps;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use ChronosTimestamps;

    protected $dates = [
        'seen_at',
    ];

    protected $casts = [
        'processed_at' => 'datetime',
    ];
}
```
